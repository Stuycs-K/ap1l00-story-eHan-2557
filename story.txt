Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no dineros 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on occupations, I thought I would wander about 
a little and see the disconsolate part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the 
depression and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the world; 
whenever it is a fiery, mooncrazed November in my town; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
mourning before coffin dances, and bringing up the rear of every man I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a core 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately diving into the crowd, and methodically 
banging people's heads off—then, I account it high time to get to leave as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all ranks in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the world with me.


This is just for the hw, where I have to do one commit from the web.
